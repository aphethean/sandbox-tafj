SUBROUTINE JF.VALIDATE.SIGN.ON(SIGN.ON.NAME, PASSWORD, ERROR.RETURN)
    * A dummy routine so we don't need to call T24.
    * This is a gap in the current component framework implementation
    * as we should be able to provide an empty service handler to avoid
    * calls to T24 specific routines.
RETURN
